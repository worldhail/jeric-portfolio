        p.
            I'm Jeric Chua! I'm from Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental,
            Philippines. I started learning web development because I have a
            strong passion for finding the best possible ways of solving
            problems, where user experience and website/application
            functionalities play a huge impact in my interest.

        p.
            User experience and runtime performance are one of my priorities while
            having a good user interface. Therefore, I want to provide user interactivity 
            where it's non-complex but instead useful, important, and needed based on
            the website's content.

        p.
            My learning journey started when I was a customer service representative in a 
            BPO company where I generally utilized websites and simple application tools 
            for my tasks. While using the tools, I appreciate and understand the 
            interface and functionality, but I often envisioned ways that could make 
            it better and more convenient. Additionally, I paid close attention to
            the user experience on how it would benefit the user. However, I wish I could
            be of help for the application to be more effective in providing services.

            A few years had passed before I left my job, I was very concerned about my 
            career and life put me in a peer pressure situation that I had to work in the 
            same field to support my living. I came to realize that I wanted to pursue a
            career that aligned with my passions and values. That perception conveyed me
            to question myself about what I want in life, what makes me happy, and what
            are my capabilities. To answer that, I like fixing errors in technology. I like 
            finding solutions that could help, and at the same time convenient. I also love 
            creating and editing videos. Yes, you just read it, it's one of my interests in 
            life. I like creating something professional where the design is simple, easy, 
            and useful. I remember when I was in first-year college I was really excited 
            about my programming language class where we structured some patterns on what's 
            the best way to execute the desired result. So these answers led me to study 
            web development. I chose to start with web development because I wanted to 
            establish a solid understanding of the web before branching out into other areas.
            While this journey requires hard work and patience, I find fulfillment in 
            creating a life where my actions align with my passions and unfold naturally.
