        p.
            I'm Jeric Chua! I'm from Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental,
            Philippines. I started learning web development because I have a
            strong passion for finding the best possible ways of solving
            problems, where user experience and website/application
            functionalities play a huge impact in my interest.

        h2 My mission
        p.
            User experience and runtime performance are one of my priorities while
            having a good user interface. Therefore, I want to provide user interactivity 
            where it's non-complex but instead useful, important, and needed based on
            the website's content.

        h2 My story
        p.
            My learning journey started when I was a customer service representative in a 
            BPO company where I generally utilized websites and simple application tools 
            for my tasks. Observing the tools I've used, I appreciate and understand the 
            interface and interactivity, but I always thought of something that could make 
            it better and more convenient. In addition to that, I'm very observant of the 
            user experience on how it would benefit the user. However, I wish I could be 
            of help for the application to be more effective in providing services.

            A few years had passed before I left my job, I was very concerned about my 
            career and life put me in a peer pressure situation that I had to work in the 
            same field to support my living. Until I realized that I wanted to live by 
            performing for who I am. That perception conveyed me to question myself about 
            what I want in life, what makes me happy, and what are my capabilities. To 
            answer that, I like fixing errors in technology. I like finding solutions that 
            could help, and at the same time convenient. I also love creating and editing 
            videos. Yes, you just read it, it's one of my interests in life. I like creating 
            something professional where the design is simple, easy, and useful. I remember 
            when I was in first-year college I was really excited about my programming 
            language class where we structured some patterns on what's the best way to 
            execute the desired result. So these answers led me to study web development.
            I started this field before moving to applications or beyond because I wanted 
            to understand the web before anything else. It takes so much hard work and 
            patience to be on this journey but typically, I know I can do it because this 
            is where I found myself and it's fulfilling when you're creating your life 
            where your actions unfold naturally.
