                    p.
                        I'm Jeric Chua! I'm from Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental,
                        Philippines. I started learning web development because I have a
                        strong passion for finding the best possible ways of solving
                        problems, where user experience and website/application
                        functionalities play a huge impact in my interest.

                    p.
                        User experience and runtime performance are one of my priorities while
                        having a good user interface. Therefore, I want to provide user interactivity 
                        where it's non-complex but instead useful, important, and needed based on
                        the website's content.
                article
                    h2 My story
                    p.
                        My learning journey started when I was a Customer Service Representative in a
                        BPO company where I always opened a website and used tools for my tasks. With
                        the tools I've used, I felt insufficient for the controls and interactivity on
                        what is needed to make it easy as a user. Technically, I've realized that I
                        don't want to continue growing even though I became an ad hoc support
                        collaborating with the Quality Assurance Team because it didn't make me feel
                        that I am performing well as what I'm passionate about. I've questioned myself
                        about what I want in life, what makes me happy, and what I can do. To answer
                        that, I like fixing errors in technology, I like to create something professional
                        where design is simple, easy, and useful, and lastly, I remember when I was in
                        first-year college that I was really excited about my programming language class
                        where we structure some patterns on what's the best way to execute the desired
                        result. So these questions and answers led me to study web development. I started
                        this field before moving to applications or beyond because I wanted to understand
                        the web before anything else. It takes so much hard work and patience to be on
                        this journey but overall, I know I can do it because this is where I see myself
                        and it's addicting when you're making your life in a sense.
