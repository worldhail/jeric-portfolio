I'm from Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental,
Philippines. I started learning web development because I have a
strong passion for finding the best possible ways of solving
problems, where user experience and website/application
functionalities play a huge impact in my interest.</p></article><article><h2>My mission</h2><p>User experience and runtime performance are one of my priorities while
having a good user interface. Therefore, I want to provide user interactivity 
where it's non-complex but instead useful, important, and needed based on
the website's content.</p></article><article><h2>My story</h2><p>My learning journey started when I was a Customer Service Representative in a
BPO company where I always opened a website and used tools for my tasks. With
the tools I've used, I felt insufficient for the controls and interactivity on
what is needed to make it easy as a user. Technically, I've realized that I
don't want to continue growing even though I became an ad hoc support
collaborating with the Quality Assurance Team because it didn't make me feel
that I am performing well as what I'm passionate about. I've questioned myself
about what I want in life, what makes me happy, and what I can do. To answer
that, I like fixing errors in technology, I like to create something professional
where design is simple, easy, and useful, and lastly, I remember when I was in
first-year college that I was really excited about my programming language class
where we structure some patterns on what's the best way to execute the desired
result. So these questions and answers led me to study web development. I started
this field before moving to applications or beyond because I wanted to understand
the web before anything else. It takes so much hard work and patience to be on
this journey but overall, I know I can do it because this is where I see myself
and it's addicting when you're making your life in a sense.</p></article><article class="about-competitive-advantage"><h2>Competitive Advantage</h2><div><h4>Communication: </h4><p>Along with my knowledge on web development, I am able to write and
