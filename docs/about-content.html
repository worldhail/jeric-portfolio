I'm from Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental,
Philippines. I started learning web development because I have a
strong passion for finding the best possible ways of solving
problems, where user experience and website/application
functionalities play a huge impact in my interest.</p></article><article><h2>My mission</h2><p>User experience and runtime performance are one of my priorities while
having a good user interface. Therefore, I want to provide user interactivity 
where it's non-complex but instead useful, important, and needed based on
the website's content.</p></article><article><h2>My story</h2><p>My learning journey started when I was a customer service representative in a 
BPO company where I generally utilized websites and simple application tools 
for my tasks. While using the tools, I appreciate and understand the 
interface and functionality, but I often envisioned ways that could make 
it better and more convenient. Additionally, I paid close attention to
the user experience on how it would benefit the user. However, I wish I could
be of help for the application to be more effective in providing services.</p><br/><p>A few years had passed before I left my job, I was very concerned about my 
career and life put me in a peer pressure situation that I had to work in the 
same field to support my living. I came to realize that I wanted to pursue a
career that aligned with my passions and values. That perception conveyed me
to question myself about what I want in life, what makes me happy, and what
are my capabilities. To answer that, I like fixing errors in technology. I like 
finding solutions that could help, and at the same time convenient. I also love 
creating and editing videos. Yes, you just read it, it's one of my interests in 
life. I like creating something professional where the design is simple, easy, 
and useful. I remember when I was in first-year college I was really excited 
about my programming language class where we structured some patterns on what's 
the best way to execute the desired result. So these answers led me to study 
web development. I chose to start with web development because I wanted to 
establish a solid understanding of the web before branching out into other areas.
While this journey requires hard work and patience, I find fulfillment in 
creating a life where my actions align with my passions and unfold naturally.</p></article><article class="about-competitive-advantage"><h2>Competitive Advantage</h2><div><h4>Communication: </h4><p>Along with my knowledge on web development, I am able to write and
